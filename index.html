                    <p>Hello</p>
                    <p>My name is Juan Myburg. I am a dedicated programmer and work diligently to produce effective software. I love seeing data flow through software to produce information related to a certain function.
                    </p>

                    <p>I sometimes program and fall into a trance and it is a feeling that makes me happy. It keeps my brain working by making it solve problems constantly.
                    </p>

                    <p>I graduated from the North-West University in 2022 with a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology. This course tought me the importance of project management and planning for a project.
                    </p>

                    <p>Although I have not yet worked in the field professionally, I believe I can create an impact on any company hiring me for any sort of programming role.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a analytical, logically grounded and also a fast learner with a thirst for knowledge.
